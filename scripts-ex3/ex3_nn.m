%% Machine Learning Online Class - Exercise 3 | Part 2: Neural Networks

%  Instructions
%  ------------
% 
%  This file contains code that helps you get started on the
%  linear exercise. You will need to complete the following functions 
%  in this exericse:
%
%     lrCostFunction.m (logistic regression cost function)
%     oneVsAll.m
%     predictOneVsAll.m
%     predict.m
%
%  For this exercise, you will not need to change any code in this file,
%  or any other files other than those mentioned above.
%

%% Initialization
clear ; close all; clc

% the workflow on the following lines is as follows:
% .jpg (or .png or whatever) --> octave image --> grayscale --> doubles --> small image --> unroll --> neural network
pkg load image;

I = imread("ex3upload.png");
G = rgb2gray(I);
D = im2double(G);
S = imresize(D, [20 20]);
flat = S(:)';

%% Setup the parameters you will use for this exercise
input_layer_size  = 400;  % 20x20 Input Images of Digits
hidden_layer_size = 25;   % 25 hidden units
num_labels = 10;          % 10 labels, from 1 to 10   
                          % (note that we have mapped "0" to label 10)

%% =========== Part 1: Loading and Visualizing Data =============
%  We start the exercise by first loading and visualizing the dataset. 
%  You will be working with a dataset that contains handwritten digits.
%

%% ================ Part 2: Loading Pameters ================
% In this part of the exercise, we load some pre-initialized 
% neural network parameters.

fprintf('\nLoading Saved Neural Network Parameters ...\n')

% Load the weights into variables Theta1 and Theta2
load('ex3weights.mat');

%% ================= Part 3: Implement Predict =================
%  After training the neural network, we would like to use it to predict
%  the labels. You will now implement the "predict" function to use the
%  neural network to predict the labels of the training set. This lets
%  you compute the training set accuracy.


fprintf('\nDisplaying Example Image\n');
pred = predict(Theta1, Theta2, flat);
fprintf('\nNeural Network Prediction: %d (digit %d)\n', pred, mod(pred, 10));

filename = "output.txt";
fid = fopen (filename, "w");
fputs (fid, num2str(pred));
fclose (fid);
